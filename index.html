            <h1> Background</h1>
            <strong> My Story</strong>
            <p> I graduated high school in 2020 as a junior. After multiple stings and looking at a career for myself,
                I attempted multiple different paths. One of them was becoming a union bricklayer, unfortunately I realized
                that the job was too physically demanding on my body and I did not want to pursue this lifestyle after careful 
                consideration. It has been an emotional ride for me these last couple of years of what I wanted to do with my life,
                I then thought of a time in my life where I recalled I wanted to learn how to be an ethical hacker. While I can't 
                just jump into penetration testing I needed to learn the basics of programming languages and servers. Currently this
                has been the first time of my life I feel so content in learning an actual skill for myself and I'm willing to dig
                deep for this.

            <strong> </strong>
            <p> My curiousity in computers has always been their, throughout my whole life I felt like I've been putting this
                on delay. I finally want to pursue what I want to do without feeling unmotivated or depresssed. I've seen people who 
                showcased amazing projects or programs and thought it was interesting and if they can do all the cool stuff why cant
                I? One program I have interest in developing is an automatic EA used to trade the financial markets as a scalper
                to get me in and out of trades. This would be a huge development for me considering I wont manuelly have to enter on
                my behalf and it wont be time consuming. Not only the financial side of becoming a web developer is one reason for
                becoming a programmer but also just following what's in my heart, this is it for me and I refuse to let myself down
                I need to show case this skill for my future self and future company of which I plan to get employed too, I believe
                those who give heart instead of just showing up for a pay check would always be a huge benefit.
            </p>
            <h1> Hobbies</h1>
            <strong> My Lifestyle</strong>
            <p> Currently Im on a huge weight loss journey of which I'm proud of, I feel I came a long way
                into my physical self. I also love to do parkour sometimes but not anything too crazy, I just love sight
                seeing and spending my time in new enviornments.
